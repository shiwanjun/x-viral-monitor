## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added independent velocity badges and leaderboard navigation for tweets embedded inside X Articles.
- Added an optional, account-isolated local cache for selected bookmark folders, with bounded retention and background refresh backoff.

### Fixed

- Fixed reposts using the quoted/original post's velocity instead of the repost's own metrics.
- Fixed bookmark-folder refresh failures repeatedly appearing as extension warnings across X tabs.
- Fixed partial, empty, and concurrent bookmark-folder refreshes from publishing stale or incomplete cache snapshots.

### Changed

- Updated the image viewer for Mac trackpads: pinch/Ctrl-wheel zooms at the pointer, two-finger scrolling pans enlarged images, and continuous gestures no longer lag behind CSS transitions.
- Updated Chrome Web Store privacy disclosures for optional AI providers, license/rule-update services, and device-local bookmark caching.

---

## [1.7.15] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Removed the remaining hardcoded Telegram URL block path that surfaced as `url:block` / "URL blocked".
- Telegram mirrors or discussion links now stay visible unless paired with explicit spam, adult, or funnel wording.

---

## [1.7.14] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Reduced content-filter false positives by no longer hiding replies solely because they contain a `tg` / `t.me` URL.
- Kept Telegram filtering for high-confidence funnel cases where Telegram links appear together with explicit ad, adult, group, or resource-promotion signals.

---

## [1.7.13] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added a Premium bookmark-folder hover menu on X bookmark buttons, with localized copy, native-style folder rows, and dark-mode styling.
- Added cross-tab bookmark-folder invalidation so X bookmark folder pages refresh after folder membership changes instead of showing stale cached timelines.

### Fixed

- Fixed removing a tweet from a bookmark folder by using X's current `RemoveTweetFromBookmarkFolder` GraphQL operation name.
- Fixed already-bookmarked tweets not reliably appearing in a target bookmark folder until manual refresh.
- Improved X dark-mode leaderboard contrast for readable titles, metadata, hover, and active states.

### Internal

- Added regression coverage for bookmark-folder i18n, dark styling, operation mapping, and folder-page cache invalidation.

---

## [1.7.10] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Hardened the desktop Tampermonkey userscript GraphQL hook for Firefox/X CSP isolation by avoiding inline page injection assumptions, exporting page-context hook functions, and parsing GraphQL response text on the userscript side.
- Fixed the velocity badge hover tooltip so it dismisses on focus loss, scroll, outside click, Escape, or leaving the tooltip.
- Fixed Grok article reply generation so long-form X Articles use article-aware prompt selection and directly publishable reply text.

### Documentation

- Documented the open-source repository vs official Chrome Web Store build model, including the Free / Pro feature boundary.

### Internal

- Ignored local content-filter sample reports generated during debugging.

## [1.7.9] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Moved the content-filter summary banner to sit immediately after the main tweet cell, before any X separator cells.

---

## [1.7.8] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed empty XVM velocity badges appearing in tweet author headers when badge data was incomplete.
- Improved content-filter DOM fallback extraction by preserving emoji image alt text from X replies.
- Tightened short spam reply detection for letter/number/emoji patterns while preserving normal short Chinese replies.

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Expanded Standard content-filter rules for reply-name funnel patterns such as "返佣", "互联网赚", and "点头像".
- Added a high-severity short-symbol reply rule for emoji/symbol-only spam while preserving normal short Chinese replies.

### Added

- Added a reply-only DOM fallback classifier for tweet detail pages so visible reply name/content/url can still be filtered when GraphQL author fields are incomplete.

---

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Limited content filtering to reply cells on tweet detail pages only; home, profile, search, lists, and the main tweet are left untouched.
- Moved the filtered-replies summary into the reply timeline instead of the page-level top area.

### Added

- Added a popup "All rules" view showing built-in and custom content-filter rules grouped by field, with custom-rule deletion from the same list.

---

## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed a content-filter summary observer loop that could make X detail pages unresponsive after filtered replies were rendered.
- Debounced content-filter DOM rescans and ignored XVM's own summary/style mutations so the filter no longer reacts to its own UI updates.

### Internal

- Added regression coverage for summary self-mutations and unchanged summary rendering.

---

## [1.7.4] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed content filtering so it remains fully opt-in: disabled settings now reliably restore reply cells hidden earlier in the same page session.
- Hardened cross-filter restore handling by marking and clearing the actual X timeline cell that was hidden, not only the nested tweet article.

### Internal

- Added a DOM-level regression test covering disabled-by-default behavior and OFF-state restore for the content filter.

---

## [1.7.3] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Made content filtering completely free, including all built-in strengths and unlimited custom keyword / regex / domain rules.
- Tuned the default content-filter rules with the latest sample files: tighter resource matching to avoid false positives, stronger name/location offline-service detection, and broader Telegram funnel detection.

### Internal

- Added regression coverage for the new sample-driven rules and Free-tier content-filter access.

---

## [1.7.2] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added Pro content filtering for adult, ad, phishing, and funnel replies with Light / Standard / Strict severity levels.
- Added local built-in rules plus user custom keyword / regex / domain rules, handle/domain whitelist support, and a filtered-replies summary strip on X pages.
- Added popup controls for content filter enablement, strength, rule counts, and custom rules.

### Internal

- Integrated the content filter into the existing premium gate, GraphQL response pipeline, and cross-filter hide-marker restore logic.

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Switched XVM Pro license activation from the shared XMP Worker to an independent `xvm-license` Worker, fixing Chrome extension CORS failures during activation.
- Added Worker-signed ECDSA entitlement envelopes and client-side verification before storing or refreshing Pro license state.
- Made XVM product scoping fail closed: missing or non-XVM `product_id` now rejects the license and downgrades to Free.
- Pinned the license proxy URL to `https://xvm-license.lengkuxiaomao.workers.dev`.

### Internal

- Added independent Worker deployment config, XVM-only product whitelist, and local ignored secret helper files.
- Kept the existing $2.9/month and $29/year Creem checkout product IDs while the new pricing products are pending.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- XVM Pro tier: Free / Trial / Pro states, a 14-day local trial, Creem-backed Pro license checks through a Cloudflare Worker proxy, and Trial/Pro-only feature gating.
- Hot-only filtering: hide low-velocity tweets using views-per-minute and absolute view thresholds, with separate short-post and long-article settings.
- Hot-only scope controls: Home, Lists, Profiles, and Tweet detail pages can be enabled independently from the popup.
- Floating leaderboard controls: compact Hot-only switch synced with the popup. Free or expired users see a disabled switch with a Pro badge; Trial/Pro users can toggle directly from X.

### Changed

- Popup filter controls now use consistent switch styling for binary feature toggles while preserving checkboxes for multi-select settings.
- The floating leaderboard's Hot-only switch was resized to match the header text scale.
- Short/Long rate-filter tabs now have a reliable selected state and keyboard focus styling.

### Security

- Pro license checks keep the Creem API key out of the extension package.

### Internal

- Added contract tests for Hot-only filtering, switch rendering, i18n lock-step, and dist sync.
- Synced source and `dist/` for the v1.7.0 extension package.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-20 (中文)

### 新增

- XVM Pro 套装: Free / Trial / Pro 三态、14 天本地试用、通过 Cloudflare Worker 代理 Creem license 校验, 并对 Trial/Pro 功能做统一 gating。
- 仅看热帖: 按 views/min + 总浏览量双阈值隐藏低流速推文, 短推和 X Article 长文可分开设置。
- 仅看热帖作用域: 首页、List、博主主页、推文详情页可在 popup 中独立开关。
- 悬浮流速榜控制: 在 X 页面悬浮面板中显示“仅看热帖”开关, 与 popup 双向同步。Free/过期用户显示灰色禁用 + Pro 角标, Trial/Pro 可直接切换。

### 变更

- popup 中二元功能控件统一为 switch, 多选设置继续保留 checkbox。
- 悬浮榜“仅看热帖”开关缩小到与标题文字更匹配。
- 流速过滤短推/长文 tab 补齐可靠选中态和键盘焦点样式。

### 安全

- 已同步 source 与 `dist/` 作为 v1.7.0 打包基础。

---

## [1.6.13] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
