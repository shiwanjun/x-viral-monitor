# X-Tools

[中文说明](README.md)

X-Tools is a toolkit for X (Twitter) creators: **viral detection** — real-time impression velocity on every tweet in your timeline, so you spot posts before they take off; **follow insights** — mutual-follow marks, one-way follow detection, and unfollow alerts for accounts you followed. Plus a full set of reading and creation helpers.

## What it does

- Shows impression velocity (views/hour) on each tweet in your timeline
- **Follow insights** — mutual-follow marks, one-way follow detection, and unfollow alerts on profile pages (planned)
- **Two badge styles** — pill solid (colored background) or inline classic (plain text), switchable in the popup
- Color-coded badges indicate traffic levels at a glance
- Hover tooltip with detailed metrics (views, likes, retweets, replies, bookmarks, viral score)
- Works across all timeline tabs (For You, Following, Lists, etc.)
- Floating **velocity leaderboard** — draggable panel ranking visible tweets by velocity (toggle in popup, off by default; columns are user-configurable)
- Copy any tweet as Markdown from the share menu
- Generate a Thank-You Star Chart for any tweet — animated visualization of every retweeter and quoter
- **AI reply generator** in the reply composer — invokes X's built-in Grok directly (no API key needed). 4 default prompt templates (default / short Chinese / sharp opinion / Tieba veteran tone); long-form posts auto-switch to a deeper-reasoning template set
- Supports English, Chinese, and Japanese
- **Standalone userscript** — don't want the full extension? A lightweight Tampermonkey script is available in `userscript/` with badges + leaderboard + settings panel

## Open Source and Official Builds

This repository contains the full X-Tools source code, including the Pro feature gates and license logic. The code is released under the MIT license, so you can audit, modify, and build it yourself.

The Chrome Web Store version is the **official build**. It provides one-click installation, automatic updates, license activation, and maintainer support. Builds loaded manually from GitHub are community/self-built versions provided "as-is" under the MIT license; they do not include Chrome Web Store automatic updates or an official support commitment.

### Free vs Pro

| Free features | Subscription unlocks |
|---|---|
| Velocity badges, velocity leaderboard, bookmark count display | Velocity filter: hide low-velocity tweets by views/min and total views |
| Image viewer enhancements and long-image reading | Separate thresholds for short tweets and long-form articles |
| Content filtering, remote rule updates, custom rules | Scope controls for Home, Lists, Profiles, and Tweet detail pages |
| AI reply drafts, copy as Markdown, Thank-You Star Chart | Future advanced monitoring, notification, and automation features |

The Pro license unlocks premium behavior in the official build. The client code is not treated as a DRM boundary; the paid value is the official build, automatic updates, license service, support, and ongoing maintenance.

### Velocity Tiers

| Icon | Color | Velocity | Meaning |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| 🌱 | Green | < 1,000/h | Normal |
| 🚀 | Orange | 1,000 - 10,000/h | Trending |
| 🔥 | Red | ≥ 10,000/h | Viral |

### AI reply generation (Grok)

A **✦ AI 生成** button appears in every reply composer. Click it to:

1. Pick a prompt template (tweets vs long-form articles auto-detected; ≥600 chars routes to the article template set)
2. Watch candidate replies stream in (you can pick the first one as soon as it appears, no need to wait for all 10)
3. Click any candidate → it's inserted into X's reply editor and the submit button activates

**No API key or third-party login required.** The extension piggybacks on the Grok session already in your X tab (`x.com/i/grok`); the entire request runs locally in your browser, no external service in the path.

Nested-reply aware: when replying to a comment underneath someone else's tweet, the prompt context is composed as 「original tweet + the reply being responded to」 so Grok sees the full conversation, not just an isolated comment.

Templates can be edited in the extension popup. **Tweet templates** and **article templates** are stored separately. The `[推文内容]` placeholder gets replaced with the source text; if your custom prompt has no placeholder, the source is prepended automatically.

## Install

### Chrome Extension (recommended)

**Chrome Web Store:**
[Install X-Tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/x-viral-monitor/dkplofpecmjmbhgjgleeflcnfgfkdfpd)

**Manual install (latest unpublished build):**

1. Download the latest release zip from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top right corner)
5. Click **Load unpacked** (top left)
6. Select the unzipped folder and confirm

### Userscript (lightweight)

Only need velocity badges and the leaderboard? Use the standalone userscript:

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Open [`userscript/x-viral-monitor.user.js`](userscript/x-viral-monitor.user.js) and click "Raw" to install
3. Access settings via the Tampermonkey menu

## How it works

The extension intercepts X's GraphQL API responses to extract tweet metrics (views, likes, retweets, replies, bookmarks, post time). It calculates the average impression velocity (`total views / hours since posted`) and renders an inline badge next to each tweet's action buttons.

For tweets not captured by the initial intercept, it falls back to fetching individual tweet details via the TweetDetail API.

### Viral Score (shown in tooltip)

A composite 0-100 score based on four weighted dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Max condition |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Velocity | 40% | 50,000/h |
| Engagement rate | 25% | 10% |
| Retweet ratio | 20% | RT/Like = 50% |
| Bookmark ratio | 15% | Bookmark/Like = 30% |
